<p><strong>Result determination and instruction:</strong><br>
1)The First step is to test the initial unbalance of the calibration sample part under detection.<br>
2)The second step is to test the unbalance value after automatic system compensation.<br>
* The theoretical value should be less than the initial unbalance of the rotor.<br>
* Compensation aims to remove the influence of the initial unbalance of the calibration sample part on the calibration benchmark measurement.<br>
* When the initial unbalance of the rotor is very small, this step is ignored.<br>
3)The third step is to test the measurement of the weight on the plane 1 of the calibration sample part.<br>
<strong><font color="red">* Measurement result of unbalance on the plane 1 : the value error should be less than +/-5% of the theorical value.<br>
  The angle error should be less than theoretical angle 1 degree.<br>
* The separation ratio of the measurement of the plane 1 to it of the plane  2 should be more than 30:1.</font></strong>
